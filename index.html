        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Anusha Biswal, and I'm currently in my first year at the University of California, Riverside, where I'm studying business as well as psychology. I'm thinking of majoring in marketing even though I haven't decided yet. I grew up wanting to work in the same industry as my parents, who are both in the business worldâ€”my mother is in supply chain management and my father is a certified public accountant. I intended to help in the company's social media promotion when I landed my first job as a part-time barista and cashier at Happy Lemon. They had stopped publishing images of their new foods and beverages, so I took it upon myself to post on both their social media accounts and mine. I liked personalizing the various postings and stories, and because of the freedom and creativity I was given, I want to keep doing this as a full-time profession. I didn't think about joining social media because I wanted to do marketing in the corporate sector. 

I enjoy reading, traveling, dancing, cooking with my mom, watching movies and documentaries about psychology, and dancing. I've been dancing competitively for ten years, and after I stopped going to the dance studio, I occasionally came back to assist my dance teacher in teaching other students. I learned some communication skills from this experience, as well as patience. Since the children I worked with ranged in age from five to twelve, they didn't have the capacity to pick up material as rapidly as I did at the time. As a result, patience was key as I took my time educating these students and making sure to correct them whenever they made mistakes. In order for students to grasp how to make the choreography flow and avoid seeming choppy and sloppy, communication was crucial when I had to teach a large group of children. Since I was in charge of routine demonstrations, they rely on me to carry out their routines. Communication was also helpful because my mum was in charge and I was merely assisting her while we were preparing new recipes. However, if one of us were to speak or hear something incorrectly, the dish might not turn out as we had hoped. My mother and I must discuss our actions and how to divide the  instructions so that we can complete the task quickly and effectively if we are to be on the same page with regard to the directions we are following. Visiting new locations and traveling kept me entertained and I found it interesting to learn about other people's cultures and ways of living. In order to further my understanding of how people around the world go about their daily lives, I would love to spend my junior year of college studying abroad. Watching psychological documentaries and films sparked my interest in the field, but I didn't want to pursue it as a full-time profession, so I'm currently considering declaring it as a minor. My abilities and perspective have been shaped by all of my interests and hobbies.
